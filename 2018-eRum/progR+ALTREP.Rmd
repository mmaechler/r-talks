## R and Me: How I got envolved

> - History of R has been well described on   [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language))
> - notably its [ref. [19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_programming_language#cite_note-19) :
> - I became involved in 1993;
> - 1995: R became _Free Software_ (licenced by GPL.  *FOSS*:= Free and Open-Source),
> - ... have been part of the _R Core_ team since its formation in 1997.

## R is made by R Core Team

## R  ==  "base" + packages { .smaller }
R : became "viral" thanks to CRAN's package system (Kurt Hornik and CRAN team):

## Use the Source! | Read R Source code (to learn from the Masters) { .build }

1. Instead of just "googling" and installing the package:
  Learn to  "Use the source!" (a small effort, yes...): see Jenny Brian's
  https://github.com/jennybc/access-r-source

2. Download the R source, and package *sources* instead of just installing them.
    - CRAN (and Bioconductor) should be your *primary* source,
    - everthing else (github, ...) only if you know that the authors *and* the
	  website are trustworthy
3. Do read package sources, even before you write your first package.
  Hence, start to *love* files  such as `<mypkg>_<n.m>.tar.gz`

## DRY, not WET !
From ![Wikipedia](Wikipedia-logo.jpeg), the free encyclopedia

- DRY:  *D*on't *R*epeat *Y*ourself

> - DRY principle := "Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system".

> - By Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas book __The Pragmatic Programmer__
- When DRY principle is applied successfully, a modification of any single element of a system does not require a change in other logically  unrelated elements. Additionally, elements that are logically related all change predictably and uniformly, and are thus kept in sync.

> - ...

## DRY vs WET solutions

- Violations of *DRY* : typically referred to as *WET* solutions

> - "WET" stands for either
>     1.  _"write everything twice"_,
>     2. _"we enjoy typing"_ , or
>     3. _"waste everyone's time"_.

> - Copy-Paste Programming is **bad**

> - Question: do useRs and progRammers prefer WET solutions  ??


## Few remarks about style { .smaller .build }

- Please^[1] use the "left arrow":
  the nice and expressive  ` <- ` instead of the  ` = ` which has many other meanings in R.
  (R is a functional language: Assignments should _stand out_ ):
    - Rstudio and ESS  both have shortcut  `[Alt]-` to produce
	\textvisiblespace{<-}\textvisiblespace
	  $\textvisiblespace`<-`\texttt{\char32} (4 chars, incl. 2 spaces)

([1]. Martin M&auml;chler; Hadley Wickham in http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html])

- *Do* comment your R code:  *You* ("your future self") will be glad already in 1 month

- Use _spaces_ in your R code ..
   and be *better* than pretty printers (e.g. from R's source):

```{R, eval=FALSE}
droplevels.data.frame <- function(x, except = NULL, exclude, ...)
  {
    ix <- vapply(x, is.factor, NA)
    if (!is.null(except)) ix[except] <- FALSE
    x[ix] <- if(missing(exclude))
                  lapply(x[ix], droplevels)
             else lapply(x[ix], droplevels, exclude=exclude)
    x
  }
```

- Apart from data frames, there are also **matrices**; they are sometimes *much more efficient*
   (e.g., Colin Gillespie's _"Efficient R Programming"_)

# R Programming | 3. Functions, Testing, Packages

## Everthing that happens in R ...

John Chambers:   In R,

> -   Everything that exists
>     - is an **Object**

> -   Everything that happens
>      - is a **function call**

> - You call functions all the time
	-  ==> do **write** own functions all the time, e.g. *inside* other functions

> - Do learn about
```{R, eval=FALSE}
lapply(X, FUN, ...)
do.call(<FUN>, args, ...)
```

## Test (in) your functions { .build }

- Can use
```
	if( <problem> )  stop(.....)
```
- Nicer, as "assertion":
```
    stopifnot( <must_be_1> , <must_be_2> ,  ...)
	```

or alternatively, since R 3.5.0,
```
	stopifnot(exprs = {
	  <must_be_1>
      <must_be_2>
	  ...
    })
```

(and yes, I know there are about a dozen packages for testing ...)


## Put your functions in a package

- and test them even more thoroughly
- write nice help pages **including** examples
- vignettes, ...

 .... (building R packages that are sustainable  --- another lecture) ...

# 4. New in R 3.5.0 | and more in future R : ALTREP

## NEWS - from new releases of R :

- Click "News" on R webpage: https://www.r-project.org/news.html
    - linking to https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/NEWS.html
    - *Many* new features , notably
- ALTREP (not prominent in NEWS) is _remarkable_ and may have large impact,
  Documented in R's source [branches/ALTREP](https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/ALTREP/ALTREP.html).
  (or with extra exploration features from its [github mirror](https://github.com/wch/r-source/).

## ALTREP | ALTernative object REPresentations

- At Stanford, 2016 after __useR!__, Gabe Becker talked about his ideas on
the potential of **alternative object representations** and (R Core member) Luke Tierney
agreed to form a working group as some of this had been floating around for quite some time
<!-- , also  mentioned in earlier DSC presentations e.g., by "alternative R" implementors. -->

- Provisional docu: https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/ALTREP/ALTREP.html
(Orig: Nov.2016; with updates up to Nov. 13, 2017)

- another Talk of Luke (at Ross Ihaka's farewell conference, Dec. 2017):
  http://homepage.stat.uiowa.edu/~luke/talks/nzsa-2017.pdf


## ALTREP -- as already  in R 3.5.0 {.smaller}

Adapted from https://svn.r-project.org/R/branches/ALTREP/ALTREP.html#sample_implementations :

### Compact Integer Vectors

- Vectors  `n1:n2` , `seq_along(n)` and `seq_len(m)`:
  represented compactly in terms of their start and end values.

In R 3.4.4 (and older):
```{r, echo=FALSE, results="verbatim"}
writeLines(readLines(textConnection("> x <- 1:1e10
Error: cannot allocate vector of size 74.5 Gb"
)))
```

where in `R 3.5.0++` and the ALTREP branch it works (very fast):
```{R, x-def}
x <- 1:1e10
```

## Compact Integer Vectors (2) {.smaller}

- Implication: for __loop__ over a large range of integers that
stops early no longer needs to allocate and fill in the full vector:
In `R 3.5.0++` (and the ALTREP branch), this is instantaneous (a few ms), where in `R 3.4.4` it needs about 1.5 sec:
```{r,  for_1e9}
system.time(for (i in 1:1e9) break)
```

The `.Internal(inspect())` function shows that a compact
representation has been used:

```{R, intern-insp}
.Internal(inspect(x))
```

## Compact Integer Vectors (3)

`sum(x)` is very smart (using alleged Gauss-as-first-grader formula $n(n+1)/2$):
```{R, sum}
system.time(print(sum(x)))
n <- length(x)
sum(x) == n*(n+1)/2
```
and `mean(x)` has been adapted to extract (in blocks) and *not* expand `x` (but still is much too slow here)

## Compact Integer Vectors (4)  {.smaller}

The following R code is not even imaginable in regular R before R 3.5.0:
```{r, new-only}
x <- 1:1e15
object.size(x) # 8000'000'000'000'048 bytes : 8000 TBytes -- ok, not really
is.unsorted(x) # FALSE : i.e., R's *knows* it is sorted

xs <- sort(x)  # instantaneous !
.Internal(inspect(xs))

anyNA(x)       # FALSE : i.e., R's *knows* it contains no NA's

## (This does *NOT* fit on the slide:
try( l4 <- x < 4 ) # no way [in principle *could* be compacted]
x <- 10:1e15
.Internal(inspect(x))
```

## Deferred String Conversions {.smaller}

- Conversion of numbers to strings is __expensive__
- Happens (with rarely needed!) default row labels on design matrices (created as)
```{R, eval=FALSE}
as.character(1 : nrow)
```

In `ALTREP`, the C-internal `coerce()` function returns a __deferred string__ coercion.
Examples:
```{R, deferred-asChar}
i8 <- 1:1e8
ce8 <- as.character(i8)
.Internal(inspect(ce8))
```

## Deferred String Conversions -2- {.smaller}

```{R, deferred-2}
system.time(print(c35 <- ce8[1e7 + 3:5])) # very fast
.Internal(inspect(ce8)) # unchanged
head(ce8)
.Internal(inspect(ce8)) # unchanged
```

## Deferred String Conversions -3- {.smaller}

```{R, deferred-3}
.Internal(inspect(ce6 <- as.character(1 : 1e6))) # shorter version
system.time( ce6[1] <- "a" ) # 350 ms
.Internal(inspect(ce6)) # now <expanded string conversion>
```

## Speedup for `lm()` {.smaller}
Benefit: significant speedup in `lm()` for fitting a model with large $n$ (R 3.5.0++):
```{R, lm-lrg, cache=TRUE}
n <- 1e7 ;  x <- rnorm(n) ;  y <- rnorm(n)
system.time(lm(y ~ x))
system.time(lm(y ~ x))
```
Where the `elapsed` timings were `11.3` and `8.8` in R 3.4.4 (on same laptop).

Speedup: due entirely to **not creating the row labels** for the design matrix.  
Yes, have faster ways: `.lm.fit(cbind(1, x), y)` is  $3 \times$  faster.
